# Project Name: Tea House

## Project Description
This is my second Tailwind CSS static landing page project. While building this project, I faced some challenges — especially in the Great Tea and Super Client sections. These two parts took me a lot of time to complete, but I’m happy because I learned a lot.

- In the Great Tea section, I revised `grid-cols-span` properties.  
- In the Super Client section, I revised position classes, `opacity`, and `z-index`.

This helped me feel more confident with these types of styles.

## What I Newly Learned While Building This Project
1. **How to use custom style on Tailwind inside the HTML `<head>` section.**
2. **In my first Tailwind project, I added the `box-border` class manually, but now I know that Tailwind has default `box-sizing: border-box` on it.**
3. **Using sentence case is the best practice for comments**
   - `// This is a comment` (Good)  
   - `// This IS A Comment` (Not Recommended)
4. **CSS property called `scroll-behavior: smooth` for smooth scrolling to bookmarks.**

## Final Thoughts
Thanks a lot for taking the time to check out my project!  
I'm learning web development, and I try to improve a little every day. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to let me know.
